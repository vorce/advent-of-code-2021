# Advent of Code 2021

Solving some [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/) problems with [Zig](https://ziglang.org/).

For fun only. Not trying to make the solutions super fast, or super pretty. There will be tests though. Also learning Zig, so I don't expect to do actually solve many days this year :)

## Notes

zig test src/day1.zig

zig run src/day1.zig
